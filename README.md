# Hangman_game


This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters of the word within a certain number of tries. The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a list of words.
- Displays the current state of the word with blanks for unguessed letters.
- Keeps track of the letters guessed and the number of tries left.
- Validates user input to ensure a single letter is entered.
- Notifies the player of correct and incorrect guesses.
- Ends the game when the player guesses the word correctly or runs out of tries.
